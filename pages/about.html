        <p class="pagePara">
          The NASA Knights team was founded in 1997, and we worked out of a small boiler 
          room with just a handful of students and mentors. Twenty-five years later, 
          we have our own dedicated shop area and meeting space (which was granted to us in 2010) 
          with over thirty dedicated students and mentors.
        </p>
        <h1 class="pageHeaders">A Community Team</h1>
        <p class="pagePara">
          Our founder, Jeff Seaton, chose New Horizons to host the NASA Knights 
          because of its function as a regional education center--students from school districts 
          all over Southeastern Virginia meet at New Horizons to participate in various programs, 
          from trade school programs to specialized STEM programs. By leveraging this location, 
          Mr. Seaton saw an opportunity to offer FIRST to a large, diverse pool of students in Southeastern Virginia. 
          Because of his vision, every high school student from public, private, or home schooled is welcome to join our team.
        </p>

        <h1 class="pageHeaders">Once a NASA Knight, Always a NASA Knight</h1>
        <p class="pagePara">
          Our team boasts strong alumni involvement. 
          This year, we have NASA Knights alumni from 2011, 2013, 2015, 2021, and 2022 graduating classes. 
          Two of our most recent sponsorships, Kelvin International and Lockheed Martin, 
          were initiated based on employees' involvement with the NASA Knights as either alumni or mentors.
        </p>

        <h1 class="pageHeaders">Impact and Outreach</h1>
        <h2 class="pageSubheaders">Local Demostrations</h2>
        <p class="pagePara2">
          Our team participates in various local demonstrations, bringing in different robots built over the years. 
          In 2023 we demonstrated at several 
          local schools to students of all ages, as well as Christopher Newport University's STEM Day, 
          New Horizons Regional Eduction Center's Center of Autism, and NASA Langley. Our team engages students 
          through various activities and ensures safe and interactive elements during our demonstrations.   
        </p>
        <h2 class="pageSubheaders">Mentoring and Assisting Other FIRST Teams</h2>
        <p class="pagePara2">
          Recently in the spring of 2022, we helped the FLL Explore Team 
          Legosaurus Rex in preparing for their Explore Festival by 
          hosting a mock judging session. In addition, we provided 
          mentorship to the FLL Challenge Team Circuit Sharks, on a weekly basis during their Fall 2022 season.  
        </p>
        <h2 class="pageSubheaders">Innovative Impact</h2>
        <p class="pagePara2">
          This summer we attended the Homeschool Educators of Virginia Convention in 
          Richmond to inspire students of all ages to pursue STEM learning where we 
          demonstrated our robot. We also attended the FLL Scrimmage at Christopher Newport University, 
          where our students volunteered as judges, referees, and scorekeepers to keep students engaged 
          in STEM. In addition, we partnered with FRC team 2363, Triple Helix, to 
          build eight FLL tables to help with the local FLL competitions for the coming years.
        </p>
        <h2 class="pageSubheaders">Inclusion</h2>
        <p class="pagePara2">
          This year, with new female mentors and students, we organized a series to 
          facilitate women-specific conversations in STEM. We started female-centric 
          safe spaces for students to discuss challenges in STEM fields.
          In November 2022, we cohosted the off-season competition Rumble in the Roads 
          at Menchville High School along with teams 2363 and 1610.
